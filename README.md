# Rainfall Prediction
App to showcase my ML model for the Kaggle competition: "Binary Prediction with a Rainfall Dataset".  
It uses Optuna studies to search hyperparameters using Bayesian Optimization on the hyperparameter space.  
I use the average of two models, Random Forests and XGBoost (Gradient Boosting Decision Trees) and rebalancing on the minority class using SMOTE synthetic samples.
